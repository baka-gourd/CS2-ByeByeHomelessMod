	<LongDescription>
When a household loses its home, it will be deleted within one and half game hours if it fails to find a shelter.

This is a temporary solution to the homeless bug, keeping your city free of performance-draining homeless citizens until the developers return from their holidays.

## Important Notes

This mod has not been heavily tested. It is recommended to back up your saves before using it and to monitor your game for any issues over a period of time.
